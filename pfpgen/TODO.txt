TODO

- completely remove metadata
   - Done in frontend
- config file for arrays e.g. `Queue fooq[23]("someconfig.cfg");`
   - Done in frontend but with opposite syntax order, e.g.
      Queue fooq("foo.cfg")[23];

- Type config vs. instance configs. Type configs are like this and are for all supertypes
      PE foo("foo.cfg") {
       ...
      }

      CE foo("foo.cfg") {

      }
   - Done in frontend + test-cases

- NOTE if there is no type top level config , then having an instance config is an error
      This should be an error:

      PE foo {};

      PE top {
         foo x("something.cfg"); // ERROR - instance config specified for type with no type config
      }

   ^ this can and should be caught by the FAD compiler
   - Done in frontend + test-cases

- Keys that are in the instance config but not present in the type config should be a runtime (elaboration time) error.
- Config Root should be passed as a command line arg, e.g.
      ./pfpsim --config-path ./some/folder


- include statement:

import library_name.whatever;

^ Looks for library_name/whatever.fad in the current source path
   ^ If it's found, then it is compiled and code is generated for it
^ If it's not found, then search for the same path in the current library path
   ^ If it's found, then it's parsed so that its symbols are in the symbol tables but they're marked so code
     is not generated, but it imported/linked from the library
^ If the same name is found in both paths, give a warning



--------

- Caching:	
	-Looks if dir already exists.
		-Replace the whole simsrc dir.
		-Generate Userfile if does not exist.
