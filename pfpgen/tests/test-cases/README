This directory is where test cases for the fad compiler
can be specified. This is quite simple to do, only a
couple of rules must be followed:

   - Any file with the extension `.test` will be parsed
     for test cases.
   - The name of the file must be a valid Python identifier
      - Should be matched by `^[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*$`
      - Must not be a reserved word or the name of a built-in
        function of class.
   - The syntax of the file is the following

      <test case function name>
         - one line
         - The name that will be used for the test-case member function.
           this will be concatenated with "test_" to form the name of a
           member function in the test class, so it must also be a valid
           python identifier.
      <test case description>
         - one line
         - This is just a one-line description of the test case, no
           special restrictions. It will be the docstring of the function
      <blank line>
      <fad program>
         - 0 or more lines
         - This is the FAD program which will be compiled as the test case
         - lines are concated together and fed to the parser
      <expected result>
         - 1 line
         - First character of the line must be '%'
         - followed immediately by one of:
            - SYN: For the test to pass, a syntax error must be generated
            - SEM: For the test to pass, a semantic error must be generated
            - SUC: For the test to pass, not error must be generated

      <Any number of blank lines (0 or more)>
      <repeat>

   - For examples, see any `.test` file in this directory
